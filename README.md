# PID-Based Cruise Control System

## Overview
This project implements a **PID-based cruise control system** using **MATLAB/Simulink** to maintain vehicle speed efficiently. By leveraging **control theory principles**, the system ensures **smooth acceleration, minimal overshoot, and fast response to speed changes** under variable road conditions.

## Features
- **PID Controller Implementation:** Utilizes Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control for speed regulation.
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Vehicle dynamics modeled using a second-order transfer function.
- **Automatic Tuning:** Parameters optimized using the **Ziegler-Nichols tuning method**.
- **Performance Analysis:** Evaluates **settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error**.
- **MATLAB/Simulink Simulation:** Real-world road conditions simulated for validation.

## System Model
The vehicle's speed dynamics are modeled as:
\[G(s) = \frac{K}{s(m + b)}\]
where:
- \(K\) is the system gain,
- \(m\) is the vehicle mass,
- \(b\) represents damping due to aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance.

The PID controller follows:
\[C(s) = K_p + \frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s\]
where:
- \(K_p\) (proportional gain) reduces steady-state error,
- \(K_i\) (integral gain) eliminates residual errors,
- \(K_d\) (derivative gain) enhances transient response.

## Performance Metrics
- **Speed Tracking Accuracy:** Achieved **98% accuracy**.
- **Settling Time:** Reduced by **40%** compared to baseline models.
- **Overshoot:** Limited within **5%** to ensure smooth acceleration.
- **Stability Improvement:** Enhanced by **30%** under variable road conditions.
